# Performetrics - Express Performance Monitoring Package

Performetrics is an easy-to-use npm package for monitoring the performance of ExpressJS applications in real-time. It collects metrics such as response times, CPU and memory usage, and provides visualizations and suggestions for optimizing your applications.

## Installation

Install the Performetrics package via npm:

```shell

npm install performetrics

```

## Usage

1\. Import the Performetrics package and initialize it in your ExpressJS application:

```javascript

const express = require('express');

const performetrics = require('performetrics');

const app = express();

// Initialize Performetrics middleware

app.use(performetrics());

// Other middleware and route handlers

app.listen(3000, () => {

console.log('Server is running on port 3000');

});

```

2\. Start your ExpressJS application, and the Performetrics middleware will automatically collect performance metrics for incoming requests.

3\. Access the Performetrics dashboard:

Visit `http://localhost:3000/performance` to access the Performetrics dashboard. This dashboard provides insights into your API's performance, including response times, resource usage, and improvement suggestions.

## Customization

Performetrics offers customization options to adapt the package to your specific needs.

### Metric Collection

You can customize the metrics collected by Performetrics by extending the `metrics.js` file in the package. Adjust the `collectMetrics` function to collect additional metrics or modify the existing ones.

### Suggestions Generation

The suggestion generation logic is contained in the `suggestions.js` file. Modify the `generateSuggestions` function to customize the suggestions based on your performance optimization requirements.

### Dashboard Visualization

Performetrics comes with a built-in dashboard for visualizing performance metrics. The dashboard is available at `http://localhost:3000/performance`. However, you can also integrate other visualization tools like Grafana or Kibana to create more advanced and tailored visualizations.

To integrate with Grafana or Kibana, follow their respective documentation and configure them to connect to the Prometheus metrics endpoint exposed by Performetrics.
